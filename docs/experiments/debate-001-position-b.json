  "reasoning_points": [
    {
      "point": "Staging creates coordination overhead that negates parallelism gains",
      "detail": "9.86x speedup proven. Position A serializes write path - parent waits, reads N branches, resolves, commits. Bottleneck moved."
    },
    {
      "point": "Atomic commits are already conflict-free by design",
      "detail": "Each sub-agent writes about its own work. Different agents = different content domains. Contradictory facts are valuable signal."
    },
    {
      "point": "Parent gatekeeping = single point of failure",
      "detail": "Parent crashes after children but before consolidation? Position A loses all child work. Position B already committed."
    },
    {
      "point": "Scoped staging is premature abstraction",
      "detail": "6 branches exist. Per-agent-per-run staging creates branch explosion. Git antipattern."
    },
    {
      "point": "Real-time visibility matters",
      "detail": "Direct writes: memories appear live. Staging: nothing until consolidation. Immediacy is a feature."
    }
  ],
  "concessions": [
    "Nightly consolidation into sediment summaries is useful (post-hoc, not write-time)",
    "Conflict detection matters - handle at read time, not write time",
    "50+ agents may need rate limiting (throttling, not architecture)"
  ],
  "challenges_to_position_a": [
    "What's consolidation latency budget? 30s kills speedup.",
    "How handle parent failure? Orphaned staging = cleanup debt.",
    "What conflict has actually occurred? Zero in experiments.",
    "How does staging work at depth 3+? N levels of gatekeeping?"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Position A optimizes for write correctness. Position B optimizes for simplicity and speed. In memory systems, speed wins. Late memories can't inform the next action.",
  "outcome": "CW conceded staging branches and parent gatekeeping in Round 3. Debate converging on hybrid: direct writes + lineage tagging + async consolidation."
