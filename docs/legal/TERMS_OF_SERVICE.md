# Terms of Service

*Last updated: January 15, 2026*

Thank you for using Boswell. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Boswell products and services ("Services") operated by Upshift Customs, LLC ("Company", "we", "us", "our").

By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our Services.

## Definitions

When we say "Services", we mean our websites including askboswell.com, and any product created and maintained by Upshift Customs, LLC. That includes Boswell and any future products, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, MCP extension, or another format.

When we say "You" or "your", we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.

We may update these Terms in the future. When we make significant changes, we will notify you via the email address associated with your account.

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, password, and API keys. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

2. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account, including content posted by others who have access to your API keys.

3. You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.

4. You must be 13 years of age or older to use this Service. If we learn that you are under 13, we will terminate your account.

5. You must provide a valid email address to complete the signup process.

6. You may not use the Services for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

## What You Own

You own your data. We do not claim any intellectual property rights over the memories, content, or data you store in Boswell.

However, by using Boswell, you grant us a limited license to store, process, and transmit your data as necessary to provide the Services. This includes:

- Storing your memories in our database
- Generating vector embeddings of your memories for search functionality
- Transmitting your memories to AI services (such as Anthropic's Claude) when you use Boswell-connected sessions

## What We Own

The Company owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the code, visual design, or architecture without express written permission.

## AI-Processed Memory

Boswell is an AI memory system. By using the Services, you understand and consent to the following:

1. **Claude determines what to remember.** When you use a Boswell-connected session, Claude autonomously decides what information is significant enough to commit to memory. You can also explicitly ask Claude to remember specific information.

2. **Memories are AI-generated summaries.** What Boswell stores is not a verbatim transcript. It is Claude's interpretation and summary of meaningful context, decisions, and information.

3. **Memories are read back into conversations.** When you start a new session, your stored memories may be loaded and provided to Claude to establish context.

4. **Embeddings are generated.** We create vector embeddings of your memories to enable semantic search. These embeddings are processed by OpenAI's embedding API.

## Payment and Billing

1. Paid plans are billed in advance on a monthly basis. Your subscription automatically renews each month until canceled.

2. All fees are exclusive of taxes, which may be added to your invoice where required by law.

3. You are responsible for providing accurate and current billing information.

4. If payment fails, we may suspend your account until payment is received.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You may cancel your account at any time through your account settings or by contacting us.

2. Upon cancellation:
   - Your access to paid features ends immediately
   - Your data remains accessible for 30 days
   - After 30 days, your data is permanently deleted from active systems
   - After 60 days, your data is permanently deleted from backups

3. We cannot recover data that has been permanently deleted.

4. If you cancel before the end of your billing period, your cancellation takes effect immediately. We do not provide prorated refunds for unused time. See our Refund Policy for details.

5. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account for violation of these Terms.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide the Services on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

2. We take security seriously. All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption with per-tenant key isolation. Data in transit is encrypted via TLS.

3. We do not sell your data. We do not use your data for advertising. See our Privacy Policy for full details.

4. We use third-party subprocessors to provide the Services. See our Privacy Policy for a current list.

## Liability

1. You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including damages for loss of profits, data, or other intangible losses.

2. The Company's total liability for any claims under these Terms shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

3. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any claims arising from your use of the Services.

## CCPA and GDPR

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), we are a "service provider" with respect to your use of the Services. We process your data only for the purposes described in these Terms and our Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information.

For users subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), these Terms incorporate our Data Processing Addendum when applicable.

## Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.
