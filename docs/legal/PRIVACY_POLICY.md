# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 15, 2026*

This Privacy Policy describes how Upshift Customs, LLC ("Company", "we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use Boswell and related services ("Services").

Your privacy matters to us. We collect only what we need to provide the Services, we don't sell your data, and we're transparent about how your information is handled.

## What We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account information:** Email address, password (hashed), and billing information when you sign up for a paid plan.
- **Payment information:** Credit card details are submitted directly to our payment processor (Stripe) and never touch our servers. We store the last 4 digits and billing address for invoicing purposes.
- **Memories:** The content you explicitly ask Claude to remember, and the content Claude autonomously determines is significant enough to store.

### Information Generated by the Services

- **Vector embeddings:** Mathematical representations of your memories generated by OpenAI's embedding API. These enable semantic search across your memories.
- **Metadata:** Timestamps, branch names, tags, and other organizational information about your memories.
- **Usage data:** API calls, feature usage, and error logs to maintain and improve the Services.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Log data:** IP address, browser type, device information, and pages visited when you access our websites.
- **Cookies:** We use essential cookies for authentication and session management. We do not use tracking cookies or third-party advertising cookies.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

1. **Provide the Services:** Store your memories, generate embeddings, serve them back to Claude when you start sessions.
2. **Process payments:** Charge your subscription, send invoices, handle billing support.
3. **Maintain security:** Detect fraud, prevent abuse, protect against unauthorized access.
4. **Improve the Services:** Analyze usage patterns (in aggregate) to fix bugs and develop new features.
5. **Communicate with you:** Send account notifications, respond to support requests, announce significant changes.

We do **not** use your information to:

- Sell to third parties
- Target advertising
- Train AI models (your memories are yours alone)
- Build profiles for marketing purposes

## How Your Data Flows

Understanding Boswell's architecture helps you understand where your data goes:

1. **You talk to Claude** in a Boswell-connected session (Claude Desktop, API, etc.)
2. **Claude decides what to remember** and calls Boswell's API to commit a memory
3. **Boswell stores the memory** in our PostgreSQL database (encrypted at rest)
4. **Boswell generates an embedding** by sending memory content to OpenAI's API
5. **OpenAI returns the embedding** (a vector of numbers, not the original text)
6. **When you start a new session**, Boswell sends relevant memories back to Claude

Your memory content passes through:
- Anthropic (during the conversation where memories are created/recalled)
- OpenAI (text sent for embedding generation)
- Railway (our hosting provider)

## Data Security

We take security seriously:

- **Encryption at rest:** All memories are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with per-tenant key isolation. Even if someone accessed our database, they couldn't read your memories without your encryption keys.
- **Encryption in transit:** All data transmitted between you, our servers, and third-party services uses TLS encryption.
- **Key management:** Encryption keys are managed through AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- **Access controls:** Only essential personnel can access production systems, and only for specific support or maintenance purposes.

## Data Retention

- **Active accounts:** Your data is retained as long as your account is active.
- **After cancellation:** Your data remains accessible for 30 days, then is permanently deleted from active systems.
- **Backups:** Data is permanently deleted from backups within 60 days of cancellation.
- **Deletion requests:** You can request immediate deletion of your data by contacting us at privacy@askboswell.com.

We cannot recover data that has been permanently deleted.

## Third-Party Subprocessors

We use the following third-party services to provide Boswell:

| Subprocessor | Purpose | Data Shared |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **Railway** | Cloud hosting | All data (encrypted) |
| **Stripe** | Payment processing | Billing information |
| **OpenAI** | Embedding generation | Memory content (for vectorization) |
| **Anthropic** | AI conversations | Memories (when loaded into sessions) |
| **AWS KMS** | Key management | Encryption keys |

We do not share your data with any other third parties except as required by law.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access:** Request a copy of your data
- **Correction:** Update inaccurate information
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your data
