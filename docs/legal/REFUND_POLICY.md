# Refund Policy

*Last updated: January 15, 2026*

## Our Approach

We want you to be happy with Boswell. If you're not, we'd rather fix the problem than keep your money.

## How Refunds Work

### Monthly Subscriptions

- If you cancel your subscription, it takes effect immediately.
- We do **not** automatically prorate unused time.
- However, if you're unhappy and contact us within 30 days of a charge, we'll work with you.

### Refund Requests

Contact us at billing@askboswell.com with:
- Your account email
- The charge in question
- Why you're requesting a refund

We handle refund requests on a case-by-case basis. We're humans, not robots. If you have a legitimate concern, we'll make it right.

### What We'll Typically Refund

- Accidental renewals you didn't intend
- Charges made after you thought you'd canceled
- Service issues that prevented you from using Boswell
- Dissatisfaction within the first 30 days

### What We Won't Refund

- Requests made months after the charge
- Accounts terminated for policy violations
- "I forgot I signed up" after extended use

## Chargebacks

If you dispute a charge with your bank instead of contacting us first, we may terminate your account. Please talk to us first - we're reasonable.
